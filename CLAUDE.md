# CLAUDE.md — lorawan-codec-normalization

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) and human contributors. Read this before generating or committing code. Standard across all Intelligent Farming Foundation repositories, with repo-specific notes at the end.

## Project & licensing (non-negotiable)
- This project is licensed GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later. The full text is in LICENSE at the repo root — never modify, move, or remove it.
- Copyright holder is Intelligent Farming Foundation.
- Outbound = inbound: all contributions are made under AGPL-3.0-or-later. Do not relicense, dual-license, or add a different license. Commercial/dual licensing is handled only by counsel (see below).

## Every source file: add this header (adjust comment syntax to the language)
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
// Copyright (C) 2026 Intelligent Farming Foundation
```
- Do not paste the full license into source files — the header points to LICENSE.
- Keep the copyright line as "Intelligent Farming Foundation" (not an individual).

## Every commit: sign off (DCO)
- Sign off every commit with: `git commit -s`
- CI rejects commits without the Signed-off-by line. Agents creating commits must include it.

## Dependencies (license compatibility)
- OK to include: MIT, BSD-2/3-Clause, Apache-2.0, ISC, MPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0.
- Do NOT add: GPL-2.0-only, proprietary/closed, or non-commercial/source-available licenses (BSL, SSPL, Commons Clause, Elastic License).
- Vendored code keeps its license/attribution, recorded in NOTICE. If unsure, stop and flag it.

## AGPL section 13 (network/SaaS)
- If this software runs as a network service, users interacting over the network must be offered its complete source. Build in a way to get the source (e.g., a "Source" link to this repo).

## Commercial use / relicensing (route to counsel — do not act)
- Any commercial license, dual-licensing, CLA, or relicensing is handled only by the Foundation's IP counsel. Do not add commercial terms, exceptions, or additional permissions.

## Per-PR checklist
- New files have the SPDX + copyright header
- Commits signed off (`git commit -s`)
- No incompatible-licensed dependencies added
- Third-party code keeps its license/attribution (recorded in NOTICE)
- Network-facing changes preserve the section 13 "offer source" path
- No commercial/relicensing terms added (counsel's job)

## Repo-specific guidance

This repo ships **standalone, normalized LoRaWAN payload codecs** grouped by device category. The contract for authoring a `codec.js` lives in **AUTHORING.md** — read it before adding or editing any codec.

- **Codecs are original works.** Upstream TheThingsNetwork codecs are consulted only as reference for a device's wire format. Never copy upstream `normalizeUplink`/`normalizedOutput` as our output — we author the normalization ourselves, per device.
- **The vocabulary is fixed.** `definitions/vocabulary.schema.json` (adapted from TTN's `payload.json`, Apache-2.0, attributed in NOTICE) defines every legal key, unit, and bound. The `additionalProperties: true` relaxation is a deliberate fork from upstream — never blind-copy upstream over it.
- **`codec.js` must be console-paste-able**: plain JS, no modules/Node APIs, ES2017-max syntax. The conformance suite (`test/conformance.js`) statically lints this and runs every codec in a `node:vm` sandbox. Adding a folder under `codecs/<vendor>/<device>/` is automatically tested — no registration file.
- **Every codec ships test vectors** (`vectors.json`) covering each declared category's required keys plus ≥1 error input. Run `npm test` before committing.
- TTN-derived material (vector inputs, `reference/` snapshots) is Apache-2.0; keep the NOTICE attribution and per-file derivation comments accurate. `reference/` is excluded from the npm tarball.
